# js-qr-reader
This program is a modification of the qr-scanner repository by Nimiq
javascript qr reader without image showing up in image or canvas on html page

I made this script with jsQR.js which can be found on https://nimiq.github.io/qr-scanner/demo/
Then i took the compiled demo version of the javascript and modified it, to not include camera stream being shown on the screen.

Note: This script is much less efficient than many other qr-reader libraries that uses machine learning
